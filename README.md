## Things I implemented so far:
- Resizing support
- All FIDE chess rules
- Stockfish engine integration (windows, linux)
- Play vs bot or another player (locally)
- Sound effects
- FEN and Zobrist chess position representations

## Things I plan on adding:
- UI for move history in standard notation
- Undo move
- Importing of a game position with FEN
- Restart game function
- General UI improvements
